## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses **basic character substitution** to mimic how encryption works. For example:

| Character | Encrypted As      |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `a`       | `dfg82jr`         |
| `e`       | `hskfk7rnv`       |
| `i`       | `kjfvnawd8dn`     |
| `o`       | `xmzn29qwe`       |
| `u`       | `plz90mbvc`       |
| `space`   | `xxspxx`          |

> ⚠️ Note: This is not a secure encryption method and is intended for educational/demonstration purposes only.
